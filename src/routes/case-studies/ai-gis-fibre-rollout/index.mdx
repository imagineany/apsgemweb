# AI GIS Fibre Rollout Solution

## Challenge

A national infrastructure provider embarking on an ambitious fibre broadband rollout needed to optimize planning and deployment across diverse geographical areas. The client faced complex manual planning processes for fibre routes, difficulty optimizing deployment across urban and rural areas, limited integration between planning and field operations, inefficient resource allocation, and challenges prioritizing areas for maximum return on investment.

## Solution

We developed an innovative AI-powered GIS solution that transformed their fibre rollout strategy:

- Integrated multiple data sources including terrain data, existing infrastructure maps, population density, and economic indicators
- Implemented machine learning algorithms to optimize route planning and minimize deployment costs
- Created automated cost-benefit analysis tools for deployment prioritization across regions
- Developed mobile applications for field teams with real-time updates and digital workflows
- Built comprehensive analytics dashboards for management to track progress and ROI
- Implemented predictive maintenance capabilities to ensure network reliability
- Created a digital twin of the entire network infrastructure for simulation and planning

The solution leveraged cutting-edge AI and geospatial technologies while maintaining a user-friendly interface for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Results

The AI GIS solution delivered transformative results for the infrastructure provider:

- 45% reduction in planning costs through automation and optimization
- 38% faster route design and approval processes
- 52% improvement in resource utilization across planning and deployment teams
- Optimized deployment prioritization increasing ROI by 30%
- Seamless coordination between planning and field operations
- Reduced time-to-market for new service areas by 40%
- Enhanced ability to secure government funding through data-driven proposals

The infrastructure provider is now deploying fibre at an accelerated rate, bringing high-speed connectivity to communities more efficiently than ever before, with particular success in previously underserved rural areas.
